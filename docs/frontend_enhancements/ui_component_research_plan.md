# UI Component Analysis Research Plan

## Research Objectives
Analyze Shadcn/ui and Headless UI recommendations to improve current UI component organization, focusing on:
1. Current TailwindCSS component patterns vs Shadcn/ui approach
2. Component reusability and design system
3. Accessibility compliance improvements
4. Custom component development vs library usage
5. Performance considerations for 5000+ users
