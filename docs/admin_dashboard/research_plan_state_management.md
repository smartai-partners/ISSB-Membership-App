# State Management Analysis Research Plan

## Task Overview
Analyze the proposed state management approach combining React Query (for server state) and Zustand (for client UI state), compare to existing RTK Query implementation, and focus on user management patterns.

## Research Objectives
1. **Understand Core Technologies**
   - [x] React Query patterns for server state management
   - [x] Zustand patterns for client UI state
   - [x] RTK Query implementation patterns
   - [x] Redux Toolkit integration approaches

2. **User Management Specific Patterns**
   - [x] User authentication state patterns
   - [x] User list management patterns
   - [x] User profile/customer data patterns
   - [x] User permissions/roles management
   - [x] User action patterns (create, update, delete)

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - [x] Performance implications
   - [x] Developer experience
   - [x] Scalability considerations
   - [x] Code organization and patterns
   - [x] Integration complexity

4. **Implementation Considerations**
   - [x] Migration strategies from RTK Query
   - [x] Best practices for hybrid approaches
   - [x] Error handling patterns
   - [x] Caching strategies
   - [x] TypeScript integration

5. **Generate Comprehensive Analysis Document**
   - [x] Executive summary of findings
   - [x] Detailed comparison matrix
   - [x] User management specific recommendations
   - [x] Implementation roadmap
   - [x] Code examples and patterns

## Information Sources Strategy - COMPLETED
- [x] Official documentation for each library
- [x] Real-world implementation examples
- [x] Community best practices
- [x] Performance benchmarks
- [x] Migration case studies
