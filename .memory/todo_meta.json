Added: 1) Dynamic position detection (above/below) based on available viewport space, 2) Automatic positioning adjustment when dropdown would extend beyond viewport, 3) Proper container boundaries and overflow handling. The dropdown now intelligently positions itself above the avatar when there's insufficient space below, ensuring all menu options (Help Assistant, Accessibility, Sign Out) remain fully visible and accessible.",
